Object detection using YOLOv3 object detector

## YOLO for Object Detection
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves both localizing one or more objects within an image and classifying each object in the image.

The approach involves a single deep convolutional neural network (originally a version of GoogLeNet, later updated and called DarkNet based on VGG) that splits the input into a grid of cells and each cell directly predicts a bounding box and object classification. The result is a large number of candidate bounding boxes that are consolidated into a final prediction by a post-processing step.


We’ll be using YOLOv3 in this project, in particular, YOLO trained on the COCO dataset.

The COCO dataset consists of 80 labels, including, but not limited to:

- People
- Bicycles
- Cars and trucks
- Airplanes
- Stop signs and fire hydrants
- Animals, including cats, dogs, birds, horses, cows, and sheep, to name a few
- Kitchen and dining objects, such as wine glasses, cups, forks, knives, spoons, etc.
…and much more!
